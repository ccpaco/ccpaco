# Developer Forever Improving : 
My 'Most Used Languages' card is a bit inaccurate, most of my work here is in C# or JavaScript. Feel free to browse my repos :] 
I am also coding everyday and contributing to private projects, so don't let the lack of green boxes in my github contributions fool you. :P
